This was the first one that I created and it is a pretty simple one that basically 
just shows what IP addresses are in use on the machine that enters the script. 
This one took some time but that was only because my first one and I had to do 
some research for each piece to get the basics down. 
Although this one isn't the most helpful tool it is quick and be quite 
informative if you need to know what the ip addresses within the machine.
I then wanted to look into DORA and DHCP so looked into that.
